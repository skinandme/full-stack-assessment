# Skin + Me
We are on a mission to change the face of skincare, and we’d love for you to join us. Right now, there’s a huge problem in the world of skincare: people don’t just struggle with their skin – they struggle with how they’re supposed to deal with it. The truth is that getting great skin isn’t complicated. It’s actually just about using the right combination of prescription-strength ingredients, with a stripped-back supporting routine. Simple, right? We believe it should be. We’re united in the belief that everyone should have access to expertise, effective derm-strength ingredients and treatment plans that result in clear, healthy skin – just without the big price tag and the long dermatologist waitlist that usually comes with it.

## Values
We are thoroughly committed to and live by our values;

### Embrace the unknown
Building an incredible brand from scratch comes with challenges, and we're ok with that. In fact, we're thrilled and driven by it. We're autonomous in our forging of new, exciting paths every day. And we embrace the inevitable ambiguity and uncertainty of start-up life with courage, conviction, thoughtful communication.

### Obsess over customer delight
It goes without saying that our customers are at the core of everything we do. Right now, in their lives, they're fed up with the skincare world and the false promises from products that never work. We frame every decision on their happiness at the heart, which means we grow a loyal group of brand advocates whose lives are better because of what we do.

### Challenge and be challenged
Coldplay once sang 'Nobody said it was easy', and we agree. Every day presents new challenges, and our job to rise up to them, then challenge them ourselves. We ask questions (across every area of the business). Then we question the answers. In return, we're open to getting the same back. Because in the long run, we know we'll all be better for it.


# Developer assessment

## The Task

Attached to this repository are 4 issue tickets which contain 'stories' related to creating a simple checkout flow (similar to one we actually use). Your task is to work through 2 or 3 of these tickets to create the basis for this checkout flow. The best tickets to start with are labelled with 'good first issue' We recommend tackling one of these first. Designs are also attached. If you have any questions, please reach out. Please note, completing all the tickets is not at all necessary and we do not want you to spend more than 3 hours on this task.

## Purpose
The attached issues are designed to replicate tickets similar to those you would receive as part of the sprint process working at Skin + Me. The purpose of the overall task is to get an understanding of how you would approach a problem like this, demonstrate some of your core technical skills and to serve as a basis of the follow-up interview which will be conducted with our Senior Developers.

As mentioned above, do not feel pressured to create the entire flow or complete all tickets. Do as much as you can; Finishing one ticket to a high degree of polish is less preferable than tackling a couple and showing the range of abilities we are trying test. We mostly want to see how you think about a problem.

## Guidance

What we’d like to see
- React: Componentised front-end
- Python: You can stub a database if you like, but we still want to see consideration for the models you would use
- General: README on how to start your project.
- General: We would like you to create a private repository in your github account and commit your code to it. We would urge you to commit relatively frequently so we can get an idea of your style and approach.

_Not required but would be interesting to see if you feel it is important or shows off your knowledge and skillset particularly_
- Dockerisation
- Setting up a database
- Tests
- Integration with 3rd party services
- Running the application in the cloud

Our stack is a React Typescript front-end and a Python Flask back-end with a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy. Do not feel you have to be constrained by this stack, but these technologies can guide you if you are struggling on where to start.
